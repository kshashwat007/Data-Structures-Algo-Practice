# Given n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1 and a list of undirected edges (each edge is a pair of nodes), write a function to check whether these edges make up a valid tree.

# Input: n = 5 edges = [[0, 1], [0, 2], [0, 3], [1, 4]]
# Output: true.

# Input: n = 5 edges = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 3], [1, 3], [1, 4]]
# Output: false.
